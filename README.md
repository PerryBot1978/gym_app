## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to create a prototypical Android application for health and fitness tracking that, through its development, will provide an opportunity for our team to explore, practice, and apply the fundamental concepts of software engineering.
<br><br>
The application will implement security through its user registration and login functionality. To maximize usability, the app will support multiple user types including general, personal trainer, and guest with each user type having different capabilities. Customizable exercise plans, custom activity types, and personal goal setting will offer flexibility and a personalized user experience. Increased customer experience and engagement will be facilitated through trainer reviews. To meet market demands, features integrated into the app will include notifications, data tracking, pre-set exercise plans, pre-set activity categories, progress monitoring, in-app payments, advertisements, subscriptions, wearable device integration, and sharing via social media.
<br><br>
Each aspect of the project presents unique challenges in not only coding, but planning, documentation, design, and testing. Examining all aspects of the project entails items like context, scope, constraints, assumptions, graphics, and use of development-supportive software. Non-functional system requirements like performance and sustainability are also a major part of the overall application and will be addressed during the appâ€™s construction. Critical thinking, teamwork, project management, and programming skills will be developed by our team throughout the entire software-creation process.
